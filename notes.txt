a) Compared with the original, I didnt include:
      "sourceType": "module",
      in eslintrc.js

b) I have removed:

    "babel-core": "^6.26.3",
    "babel-preset-env": "^1.7.0",
    "babel-register": "^6.26.0",

    and replaced with:

    "@babel/core": "^7.4.3",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.4.3",
    "@babel/register": "^7.4.0",

1.
 -Fill the project data in package json.
 -Choose the dependencies in package.json
  (For Bootstrap, remove main.css & normalize.css)
2. Run npm install
3. Remove zzz-style-test.js & zzz-js-test.js from the root folder after making sure prettier and eslint are working


NOTES ON FOLDERS:
src/: This is where the original source files are located,
before being compiled into fewer files to dist/, public/ or build/.

dist/: the compiled code/library, also named public/ or build/ target/
The files meant for production or public use are usually located here.
A directory where files will be stored that can be directly used by others
without the need to compile or minify the source code that is being reused.
f you want to distribute a JavaScript library, it's advisable to put the plain (not minified) source code
into a src (source) directory and the minified and obfuscated version into the dist (distributable) directoy,
so others can grab the minified version right away without having to minify it themselves.

lib/: external dependencies (when included directly).

node_modules/: includes libraries and dependencies for JS packages, used by Npm.
vendor/: includes libraries and dependencies for PHP packages, used by Composer.
bin/: files that get added to your PATH when installed.
